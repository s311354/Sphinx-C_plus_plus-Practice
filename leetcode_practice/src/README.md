## Overview of General Alogrithms ##

#### Dijkstra's Alogrithms ####

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

The algorithm exists in many variants. Dijkstra's original algorithm found the shortest path between two given nodes, but a more common variants fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.

#### Bellman–Ford Alogrithms ####

The Bellman–Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph. It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm from the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative number.
