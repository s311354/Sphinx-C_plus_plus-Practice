Recap the Knowledge on C++ Standards
==========================================

The history of C++/basic concpet of C++98
--------------------------------------------------

Early C++
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+ 1979: C with Classes first implemented:
    + New features: `classes <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/classes>`_, `member functions <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/member_functions>`_, `derived classes <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/derived_class>`_, separate compilation, `public and private access control <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/access>`_, `friends <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/friend>`_, type checking of function arguments, `default arguments <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/default_arguments>`_, `inline functions <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/inline>`_ (since C++17), `overloaded assignment operator <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_assignment>`_, `constructors <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constructor>`_, `destructors <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/destructor>`_, call-function and return-function.

The basic concpet of C++11
------------------------------------------------

C++11 is the second major version of C++ and the most important update since C++98. A large number of changes were introduced to both standardize existing practices and imporve the abstractions available to the C++ programmers. Since 2011, currently, C++ updates every 3 every regularly.

See the `Cppreference C++11 page <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/11>`_ for more info.
